# FakeNews-Debunkinator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

FakeNews-Debunkinator is a self-learning AI tool that gives you an estimate how likely a certain news article is "fake news". 


## Background

Fake News spread faster and wider than real news and they are increasingly harder to spot as the original sources become jumbled together. The responsibility falls on reader's shoulders as there is no tool to search for the original source of the information and give you some approximation on how suspect this new information is.


## How is it used?

The users are us, normal internet dwellers, who surf on the waves of interwebs reading interesting news articles, although mainly clickbaits, unaware of all the pitfalls and other hazards awaiting for us. We have unwavering confidence in our ability to spot fake news as we have been taught source criticism in school. However, the internet has changed and the game has channged with it. 

But do not worry! Here comes the solution you thought you did not need: FakeNews-Debunkinator. Next time you open a news article, this amazing application tells you the original source of the article and the probability that the news you are reading is fake or politically biased. Now it is easier to use that source criticism of yours.


## Data sources and AI methods
The test data (that is used to train the AI) is collected manually by a group of unbiased humans called "Data-verifunkinators". They feed the AI with real and fake news. In time, AI learns the difference.

Birth of the AI: The mother and father of FakeNews-Debunkinator are two groups of exceptional individuals called AI-codinators and NeuralSurginators who give birth to this beautiful creature who feasts from the breastmilk of Data-verifunkinators.

## Challenges

* My project does not solve the possibility that the solution becomes the new root of this very same problem as people start to use and trust it.
* FakeNews-Journalistinators start producing fake news articles that get increasingly better scores on FakeNews-Debunkinator and people end up faring worse than before. 
* Important new information (cure for COVID, nuclear fusion etc.) might get wrongly FakeNews-DeBUNKINATED resulting in total omission.

## What next?

My project could grow if someone with the motivation, expertise, people, money and right contacts would take over this project and produce it from start to finish.
